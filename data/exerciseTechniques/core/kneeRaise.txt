TECHNIQUE:

1. Step into the machine and place your forearms on the pads. Grab the handles to secure yourself.

2. Step off the footrests and let your legs hang. Your upper body and core should be tense.

3. Lift both legs upward at the same time, bending your hips and knees simultaneously.

4. Bring your knees up as far as possible. Achieve this by bending your hips more at the end of the movement and slightly crunching your stomach. If your butt is still touching the back pad, you probably have some room left to bend your abs. Hold the position for a few seconds.

5. Lower both legs slowly and in a controlled manner.
