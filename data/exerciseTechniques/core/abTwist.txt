TECHNIQUE:

1. Sit on the floor with your legs in front of you. Your knees should be about level with your upper abdominal muscles. Make sure the soles of your feet touch the ground.

2. Lift the weight (if you’re using one) with both hands over your knees. If you’re not using a weight, extend your hands or cross them in front of your chest.

3. Pull your shoulder blades back, lift your chest, and lean back a bit. You’ll feel the tension in your core. However, don’t lean back too far. Keep your back straight — no hunching allowed.

4. Rotate your arms and upper body in one direction. The weight in your hands should move down slightly but never touch the ground at any point.

5. Upon completing the movement, rotate your upper body towards the other side. You may choose to do so directly or pause briefly in the middle to intentionally sustain tension in your core.
