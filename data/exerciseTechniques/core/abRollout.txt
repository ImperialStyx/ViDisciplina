TECHNIQUE:

1. Kneel on the workout surface and place the ab wheel in front of you.

2. Firmly grasp the ab roller with both hands and position it on the floor directly in front of you.

3. Engage your abs, so they slightly move inward. You can round your back a bit while tightening your abdominal muscles.

4. Roll forward by extending your arms. Your back will straighten a little, but your abs should remain tense. Your legs and hips will lower along with your torso.

5. In the stretched position, continue kneeling with your hands securely on the ab roller in front of or above your head.

6. To return from the stretched position, engage your abs and pull your torso back evenly. Your hips and the ab wheel should move backward together. Avoid using your hips to pull your body back.
