TECHNIQUE:

1. Hold a dumbbell in one hand.

2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, standing upright.

3. Place your free hand on your hip. Let the hand holding the dumbbell hang on the other side of your body. This is the starting position.

4. Bend your upper body to the side where the dumbbell is located. This will lower the dumbbell straight down. Bend as far as you can until you feel tension in your side abdominal muscles.

5. Reverse the movement: Bend your upper body in the opposite direction and lift the dumbbell straight up. Perform the movement until you feel tension on the other side. Repeat this movement, then switch the dumbbell to the other hand and complete the same number of repetitions to finish the set.
