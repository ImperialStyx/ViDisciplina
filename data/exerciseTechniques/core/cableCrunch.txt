TECHNIQUE:

1. Attach the triceps rope to the upper cable pulley and start with a lighter weight to learn the proper form.

2. Hold the triceps rope with both hands and kneel down, facing the cable machine. Your hands should be in front of your body, holding the rope. Make sure there’s enough space to perform the crunch movement without issue, but don’t go too far back, as it can compromise your stability and form.

3. Lean forward with your upper body and head, passing the triceps rope over your head. Your hands should now be on either side of your head, holding the rope.

4. Tuck your chin in, pointing it towards your knees.

5. Lower your upper body, moving the weight as a whole. Avoid arching your upper back. Engaging your upper abs will happen automatically as you try to bring your chin closer to your knees. Keep the triceps rope’s position behind your head constant throughout the movement.

6. Pause briefly in the lowered position before lifting your upper body back to the starting position in a controlled manner. The moving weight shouldn’t touch the rest of the weight stack just yet. Keep the tension throughout the rep. When your set is finished, then you can let the weight stack down completely.
