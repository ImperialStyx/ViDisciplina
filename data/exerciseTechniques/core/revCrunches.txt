TECHNIQUE:

1. Lie on your back with your legs close together.

2. Place your arms directly beside your hips and press your palms onto the ground.

3. Lift your legs slightly off the ground so they’re no longer resting. You’re now in the starting position.

4. Lift your straight legs fully at the hips so they form a 90-degree angle with your upper body. Slight knee bending during the movement is normal. When you reach the angle, lift your hips, and straighten your legs upwards.

5. In a controlled manner, lower your hips back down and bring your legs back to the starting position.
