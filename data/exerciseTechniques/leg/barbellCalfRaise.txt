TECHNIQUE:

1. Adjust the rack height before stepping into the power rack to lift the barbell. The bar should be about at the height of your armpits, making it easy to lift the weight out of the rack.

2. Step into the rack so that the barbell rests on your neck and touches it. To do so, bend your knees slightly. Your foot position should be shoulder-width apart.

3. Place your hands on the barbell from behind, wider than shoulder-width apart.

4. Lift your body so that the bar presses against the lower part of your neck. The bar should not press your head forward.

5. In this position, your buttocks are slightly stretched backward, your lower back forms a very slight arch, and your upper back is straight.

6. Lift the barbell out of the rack by straightening your body. Take a few steps away from the rack with the barbell on your neck.

7. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. The weight is now resting on your neck. Your lower back still forms a slight arch, and your upper back is straight. Do not hunch.

8. Choose your body position so that the barbellâ€™s weight is evenly distributed over your feet. You are now in the starting position.

9. Raise your body by extending your ankle and lifting your heels off the ground. Raise your heels as far as possible without discomfort and without risking losing your balance. At the end of the movement, hold for a brief moment, and then lower your body slowly and in a controlled manner back to the starting position.
