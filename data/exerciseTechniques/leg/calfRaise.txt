TECHNIQUE:

1. Stand on the step with your toes slightly narrower than shoulder-width apart. Your heels should extend beyond the step.

2. Keep your back straight and maintain a slight arch in your lower back. You can place your hands on your hips or choose a posture that provides the best balance.

3. Lower your heels by bending your ankles to reach the starting position.

4. Raise your heels by extending your ankles as far as you can without losing balance or feeling uncomfortable. Hold the extended position for a brief moment, and then slowly and in a controlled manner, lower your body back to the starting position.
