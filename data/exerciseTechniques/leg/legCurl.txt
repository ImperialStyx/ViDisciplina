TECHNIQUE:

1. Lie face down on the machine’s bench, positioning your hips where the angle between the upper body and thigh pads changes.

2. Place your legs under the leg pad, making sure it’s above your heel and below your lower legs. Adjust the pad if needed, typically using a lever along the leg pad.

3. Hold onto the handles with your hands to stabilize your upper body.

4. Curl your lower legs towards your butt, initiating the movement from your knees. Keep your hips and upper body stationary.

5. Continue the movement until you feel your pelvis losing support.

6. Lower the weight back down in a controlled manner, being careful not to fully extend your knees.
