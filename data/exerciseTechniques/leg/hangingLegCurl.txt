TECHNIQUE:

1. Adjust the foot locksâ€™ distance based on your height. Your knees should rest securely on the pad while allowing you to extend your legs without stressing your knee joints. Use the handles found on most machines to test the movement carefully without bearing your full weight.

2. Once everything is set up, wedge your feet between the pads and kneel on the knee pad.

3. Keep your upper body upright and avoid rounding your back.

4. Place your hands on your chest.

5. Slowly lean your upper body forward by extending your knees, without fully straightening them.

6. Raise your torso by bending your knees, keeping your back straight throughout the exercise.
