TECHNIQUE:

1. Before getting into the rack, set the barbell supports to about the height of your armpits. This height allows most athletes to lift the weight smoothly.

2. Position yourself in the power rack so the barbell is behind your neck and touching it. You’ll need to bend your knees slightly due to the height adjustment. Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart.

3. Place your hands wider than shoulder-width on the barbell from behind.

4. Lift your body slightly and position it so the bar presses against your lower neck. Don’t lift the weight out of the rack yet. The bar shouldn’t push your head forward or be set too low, risking it slipping backward.

5. In this position, your butt is pushed back a little, your lower back forms a slight hollow back, and your upper back is straight. Your upper body leans forward slightly under the barbell.

6. Lift the barbell out of the rack by straightening your body. Take a few steps back from the supports to perform the exercise without touching them.

7. Stand shoulder-width apart again. The weight rests on the back of your neck. Maintain the same back posture: a slight hollow back in the lower back and a straight upper back. Don’t arch it.

8. Adjust your posture so the weight of the barbell is evenly distributed across your feet. While some recommend carrying the weight primarily through the heels, this can cause balance issues.

9. Lower your body by slowly bending your knees and hips simultaneously in a controlled manner. Your butt will naturally push back a little, and your upper body will lean forward.

10.	Stop the downward movement when your thighs are parallel to the floor.

11.	Raise your torso back up by extending your knees and straightening your hips.
