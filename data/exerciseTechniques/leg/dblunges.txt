TECHNIQUE:

1. Stand upright, about hip-width, with the dumbbells at your sides in your hands.

2. Take a big step forward with the leg you want to train first.

3. After performing the step, lower your torso straight down. Your front leg (training leg) carries your weight, while the other leg stabilizes your body. Stand firmly on your front foot and on your back foot’s toes, with the heel in the air.

4. During the downward motion, make sure your front knee does not push in front of your toes. If this happens, your step is too small or your torso is bent too far forward. The angle between your upper and lower leg of the training leg should be about 90 degrees.

5. The knee of your stabilizing leg should only lightly touch the ground, if at all, during the downward movement. Don’t release tension in your training leg by kneeling down with the other leg.

6. At the end of the downward movement, push your upper body up with your training leg.

7. You can now do the second repetition directly with your second leg, or first complete all reps with one leg and then the other leg.
