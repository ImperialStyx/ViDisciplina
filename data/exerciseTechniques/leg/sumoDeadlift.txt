TECHNIQUE:

1. With the barbell on the floor, stand in front of it with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Stand close enough so your shins don’t touch the barbell, but your feet should be under it, around mid-foot height.

2. Bend your knees and hips, gripping the barbell firmly with both hands using an overhand grip about shoulder-width apart. Your arms should be inside your legs. Ensure your shoulders are directly above the bar and your hips are between your head and knees.

3. Maintain a minimal arch in your lower back, keeping the rest of your back straight. Align your head with your spine and hips. Tighten your core. You’re now in the starting position.

4. With straight arms, lift the weight off the floor by simultaneously straightening your legs and standing upright. Try to lift the barbell in a vertical line upward. From the side, the weight should move straight up without curving. Keeping the bar close to your shin (without touching it) works best for this.

5. Finish the movement by pushing your hips slightly forward, standing upright, and holding the bar in front of your hips. Do not over-arch your back. Hold this position momentarily.

6. Lower the bar back down by bending your legs and hips, returning to the starting position. You can put the weight down on the floor, but for more repetitions, maintain body tension and don’t relax it.
