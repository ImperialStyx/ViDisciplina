TECHNIQUE:

1. With the barbell in the rack and safeties set, stand so your shoulders touch the bar.

2. Move forward so the bar rests firmly on your shoulders, slightly touching your neck.

3. Extend your arms, bend your elbows, and grip the bar with an underhand grip (palms up). Depending on your anatomy, you may secure the bar with just a few fingers (see video). Keep your elbows pointing forward.

4. Lift the bar out of the rack and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.

5. Maintain a straight upper body while slightly hollowing the lower back and stabilizing the middle and upper back.

6. Slowly lower the weight by bending your knees in a controlled manner. Focus on maintaining balance. Keep your elbows pointing forward, and your back straight without arching. Lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the floor.

7. Push the weight back up by standing up. Your heels should always touch the floor, with the weight evenly distributed across your entire foot.
