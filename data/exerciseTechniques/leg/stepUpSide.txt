TECHNIQUE:

1. Stand hip-width apart from the flat bench (or your chosen surface), with your feet parallel and dumbbells in your hands by your hips.

2. Place your training leg on the bench, ensuring your foot is centered to prevent slipping when you transfer your weight.

3. In the starting position, engage your core and keep your back straight. Your training leg should be bent, and your second leg extended.

4. Push your body up onto the bench using only your training leg. Keep your second leg extended and avoid using it for assistance.

5. At the top of the movement, bring your second leg next to the training leg, either placing it on the bench or hovering it briefly. Maintain tension in the training leg throughout the rep.

6. Reverse the movement to return to the starting position, touching the floor with your second leg without fully relieving the training leg.

7. Once youâ€™ve completed the reps for one leg, switch sides and repeat with the other leg, ensuring equal repetitions.
