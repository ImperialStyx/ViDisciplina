TECHNIQUE:

1. Set the barbell at the appropriate height (see above).

2. Lie flat on your back below the barbell. The barbell should be at about chest height. Depending on your preferred muscle focus, you can change this position (see above).

3. Grab the bar with a grip slightly wider than shoulder width with both hands.

4. Tighten your shoulder blades and lift your upper body off the ground. Keep your back straight. Youâ€™re now in the starting position.

5. Pull your chest up towards the barbell by bending your arms. This primarily activates the upper back. Perform the movement as far as you can without causing discomfort. Some people touch the bar with their chest, while others maintain a distance between their body and the barbell. Hold the position for a brief moment and then lower your upper body back to the starting position in a controlled manner.
