TECHNIQUE:

1. Stand in front of the barbell on the ground, about shoulder-width apart.

2. Slightly bend your knees, keeping your back straight. Grab the barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing up/forward, thumbs pointing towards each other).

3. Lift the barbell with a straight back, using your legs. Stand up normally, with the barbell in an overhand grip in front of your thighs.

4. Straighten your back, creating a slight arch. Pull your shoulders back a bit and keep your head upright. Youâ€™re now in the starting position.

5. Bend your upper body at the hips in a controlled manner, keeping your legs straight. Slide the barbell down your legs.

6. Stop bending when you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, or when bending further would require rounding your lower back. Avoid bending your back.

7. Then, straighten your upper body back into the starting position. Throughout the entire movement, keep your back straight and your legs straight.
