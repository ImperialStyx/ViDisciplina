TECHNIQUE:

1. Adjust the weight and stand in front of the bench.

2. Grab the lat bar with your preferred grip (see above) and sit with your arms extended up to the bar. At this point, you’ll start to lift the training weight a bit. Lock your legs under the pads.

3. Pull your shoulders back slightly and form a small arch in your back. You’re now in the starting position.

4. Pull the lat bar down in front of your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body. Aim to move the weight towards your hips, not behind your back. Only at the end of the pulling motion should your elbows move a bit behind your back. Hold this position for a moment.

5. Slowly raise the weight back up to the starting position in a controlled manner.
