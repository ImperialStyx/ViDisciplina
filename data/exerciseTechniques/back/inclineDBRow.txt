TECHNIQUE:

1. Grab the dumbbell and walk towards the incline bench, facing it.

2. Lie face down on the incline bench. Rest your chin at the end of the bench. Stabilize your body by positioning your feet shoulder-width apart behind you.

3. Let your arms hang down with the dumbbell in your chosen grip variant. This is your starting position.

4. Pull the dumbbells up towards your upper body. Your elbows should pass close to your body. Then lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position in a controlled manner.
