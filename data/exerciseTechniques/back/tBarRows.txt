TECHNIQUE:

1. Stand with your feet on either side of the barbell, which should already be positioned. The barbell should be between your legs, and you should be facing the weight plates.

2. Place the handle behind the weight plates by threading it through the center of the bar.

3. Bend your knees slightly and keep your back straight, with a slight arch. Stick your butt out and grip the handle tightly.

4. Tense your abs and pull your shoulder blades back a little. Youâ€™re now in the starting position.

5. Without swinging, lift the barbell towards your upper body by pulling on the handle. The movement is complete when the weight plate is just in front of your chest. Hold this position for a few seconds, then lower the weight back to the starting position slowly.
