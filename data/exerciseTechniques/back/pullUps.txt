TECHNIQUE:

1. Stand under the pull-up bar and grab it slightly wider than shoulder-width with both hands in an overhand grip (back of hand facing you).

2. Bend your legs a bit and let yourself hang from the bar.

3. Pull your shoulder blades together.

4. Now use your arms and back muscles to pull your body up until your chin is level with the bar.

5. Slowly lower your body back down to the hanging starting position in a controlled manner.
