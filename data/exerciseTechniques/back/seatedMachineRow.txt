TECHNIQUE:

1. Sit on the machine facing the chest pad.

2. Adjust the seat height so that you can reach the handles when you extend your arms without too much inclination.

3. Adjust the distance of the chest pad so that you can reach the handles with straight arms and pulled shoulders with your fingertips. Your upper body presses against the chest pad.

4. Bend your shoulders forward a little and grab the handles in your preferred grip (see above).

5. Straighten your upper body again and pull your shoulder blades back. You also pull the handles back a little â€“ but your arms remain slightly bent.

6. Now pull the handles towards your upper body. The movement is predetermined by the machine. Depending on the grip, you guide your elbows close to your body. Pull the handles as far back as your musculoskeletal system or the machine allows.

7. Slowly and controlled, let the handles and the weight go back to the starting position. Keep your shoulder blades pulled in throughout the execution.
