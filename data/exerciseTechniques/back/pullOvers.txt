TECHNIQUE:

1. Grab the dumbbell, sit down at one end of the weight bench, and hold the dumbbell in one hand on your thigh.

2. Lie on your back in a longitudinal position, bringing the dumbbell with you and holding it firmly on your chest.

3. Change your grip and position your hands under the weight plates (see video tutorial). Hold the dumbbell across the inside of the weight plates.

4. Form a “bridge” similar to the bench press. Press your shoulders and buttocks into the cushion of the weight bench while forming a slight hollow back.

5. Straighten your arms with a slight bend in the elbows and lift the dumbbell over your chest. Adjust your elbows according to your muscle focus. This is your starting position.

6. Lower the weight down behind your head, moving your arms straight back at the shoulders. Your elbows should only bend a little more, but not fully fold. End the downward movement when your forearms are parallel to the ground. The further you lower the weight, the more the back is involved, but the shoulders are also loaded. Hold the stretched position for a brief moment before returning to the starting position.
