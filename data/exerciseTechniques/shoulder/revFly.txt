TECHNIQUE:

1. Set the incline bench to a relatively flat angle.

2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and lie with your stomach on the backrest of the incline bench. Let your arms hang in front of the bench.

3. Slightly bend your elbows. Youâ€™re now in the starting position.

4. Lift both arms evenly and in a controlled manner to the side and back or up. Keep the angle in your elbows constant during the movement. Stop the movement before you need to noticeably pull your shoulder blades together to continue.

5. Hold the position for a brief moment. Slowly lower your arms to the side and bring the dumbbells together in front of your chest.
