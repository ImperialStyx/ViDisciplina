TECHNIQUE:

1. Grab the dumbbells and stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the dumbbells at your sides.

2. Now, raise one or both arms forward, turning your palms down. Lift your arm until itâ€™s parallel to the floor, with the dumbbells at about shoulder height.

3. Slowly lower the dumbbells in a controlled manner, returning your hands to the starting position (palms facing each other).

4. Bonus: For an isometric challenge in your last rep, hold the dumbbells in the raised position as long as possible and lower your arms very, very slowly (60-120 seconds).
