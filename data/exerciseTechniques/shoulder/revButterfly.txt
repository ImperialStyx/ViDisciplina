TECHNIQUE:

1. Sit on the seat cushion facing the machine. Slide forward until your upper body touches the front cushion.

2. Grab the handles with your hands in your preferred variation (see above).

3. Slightly retract your shoulders. Youâ€™re now in the starting position.

4. Slowly and controlled, spread your arms. End the movement when your shoulders need to move more intensely to continue.

5. Pause briefly in that position, then move your arms back to the starting position just as controlled, without completely resting the weight before the next repetition.
