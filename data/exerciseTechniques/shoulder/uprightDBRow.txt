TECHNIQUE:

1. Stand hip-width apart. Hold the dumbbells in your hands in front of your hips (not on the side) in an overhand grip (back of the hand outwards).

2. Keep your back straight, your head neutrally forward, and stick out your chest.

3. Now, bring the dumbbells up close to your body in a controlled manner.

4. Pull your hands up in a controlled and steady manner, without swinging, until the dumbbells almost touch your chin. Your elbows should be higher than your wrists at all times.

5. At the end of the movement, bring your hands back down in a controlled manner and start a new repetition.
