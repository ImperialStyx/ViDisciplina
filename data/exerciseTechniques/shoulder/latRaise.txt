TECHNIQUE:

1. Grab dumbbells in both hands.

2. Stand in front of a mirror, with your feet about shoulder-width apart.

3. Bend your elbows slightly, with your palms facing away from your body and outward. This is the starting position.

4. Slowly lift the dumbbells up, keeping your arms parallel to the ground and maintaining the slight bend in your elbows. Avoid rotating your arms during the lift.

5. Hold the position for a brief moment, and then lower your arms back to the starting position, slowly and under control.
