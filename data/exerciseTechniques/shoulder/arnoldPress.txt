TECHNIQUE:

1. Set the back of the incline bench as steep as possible.

2. Sit on the bench and place the dumbbells on your knees. Your back presses against the backrest and your feet are firmly on the floor, so you have a stable sitting position. You should form a slight hollow back to relieve stress from the back.

3. Now lift the dumbbells in front of your torso. This works easier if you lift one knee at a time to get one dumbbell into position with momentum. This swinging motion is usually only necessary as your workout progresses when the weights become significantly heavier. To start, it’s best to choose a weight that you can get up without using your knees.

4. The dumbbells are now in front of your torso with your palms facing you.

5. Now push the weight up and extend your arms. As you do this, rotate your forearms 180 degrees. At the end of the movement, your palms face forward.

6. Do not fully extend your elbows, but keep them slightly bent (see chapter “Common Mistakes”).

7. Once at the top, return the dumbbells to the starting position in front of your torso (point 4). At the end of the movement, your palms face you again.
