TECHNIQUE:

1. Sit sideways on the flat bench and place your palms on the edges to your left and right.

2. Stretch your feet out so your butt clears the seat, with your hands supporting your body.

3. There should be about 15 to 20 centimeters between your butt or lower back and the flat bench, but this can vary depending on your body size.

4. Rest your feet on your heels with your legs slightly bent at the knees. Straightening your legs completely makes the exercise more challenging, which is better for advanced users.

5. Lower your butt by bending your arms at the elbows, keeping your feet in the same place on the floor.

6. At a 90-degree angle between your forearms and upper arms, youâ€™ve completed the movement.

7. Lift your butt back up by straightening your arms, keeping the elbows slightly bent to protect the joints.
