TECHNIQUE:

1. Lie down on your back on the flat bench. The barbell in the rack should be at eye level.

2. Place your feet firmly on the ground. Don’t lift them like you sometimes see in the gym. You’ll achieve the best stability with your feet on the ground.

3. Pull your shoulder blades back.

4. Tighten your lower back and create a slight arch. Press your upper back into the flat bench to form the “bridge.”

5. Extend your arms straight up and grip the barbell about shoulder width apart.

6. For safety, make sure your thumb grips the bar too.

7. Lift the barbell out of the rack.

8. Lower the bar evenly and in a controlled manner above your chest. Don’t flare your elbows out too much or press them too close to your body. Find a neutral elbow position that doesn’t cause pain.

9. Keep your shoulder blades tucked in while lowering and breathe in.

10. The barbell might end up lower than usual due to the narrow grip. That’s fine. Ensure your posture feels natural and pain-free when lowering the bar.

11. Perform the upward movement quickly but with proper form. Exhale as you do so.

12. At the top, maintain body tension, don’t fully extend your arms, and repeat the movement.
