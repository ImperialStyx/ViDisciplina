TECHNIQUE:

1. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arms extended alongside your body.

2. Raise the dumbbells simultaneously by bending your elbows. As you start the movement, turn your palms forward so that they face forward at the beginning of the sequence.

3. Once at the top, hold the tension briefly. The backs of your hands should now face forward.

4. To complete a biceps curl repetition, lower the dumbbells back down in a controlled manner. Your palms will follow the same sequence in reverse order.
