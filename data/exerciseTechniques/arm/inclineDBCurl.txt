TECHNIQUE:

1. Grab dumbbells in both hands.

2. Sit on the incline bench seat with an upright body.

3. Lean your upper body back. Your back and head should touch the backrest.

4. Let your arms with the dumbbells in your hands hang down to the sides. Turn your palms forward (underhand grip). You’re now in the starting position.

5. Bend your arm at the elbow and lift the weight up. Aim to move the dumbbells towards your shoulders. Important: Don’t move your shoulders during this motion. The upper arm shouldn’t change its position.

6. Once at the top, hold the weight briefly, then lower it in a controlled manner back to the starting position.
