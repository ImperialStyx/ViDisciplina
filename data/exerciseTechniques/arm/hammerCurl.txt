TECHNIQUE:

1. Grab the dumbbells and stand with your feet hip-width apart. Hold the dumbbells at your sides with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).

2. Bend your elbows and raise both dumbbells at the same time. Keep your palms facing each other throughout the movement, without rotating them.

3. When your elbows are bent, youâ€™ve reached the end of the movement. Hold the tension for a moment.

4. Lower the dumbbells slowly and with control, keeping your palms in the same position. At the end, your arms are fully extended, and the dumbbells are beside your body.
