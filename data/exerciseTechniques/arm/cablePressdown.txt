TECHNIQUE:

1. Stand in front of the cable tower in your preferred foot stance (refer to above).

2. Firmly grasp the rope attached to the top of the cable machine with both hands.

3. Pull the rope towards you by pressing your elbows to the sides of your torso. Your arms should be bent at about a 90-degree angle at the elbows. With this position, you’ve already lifted the weight a little off the block. You’re now in the starting position.

4. Press the rope down. Try to move the two ends of the rope towards your pockets. This will make the rope move slightly apart and your hands just to the side of your body. The pressing movement should only come from extending the elbows that are fixed to the sides. Don’t push your elbows forward or backward.

5. Move the rope down until your arms are fully extended. Hold the position for a moment, then move the rope back up to the starting position in a controlled manner.
