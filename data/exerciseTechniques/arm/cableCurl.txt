TECHNIQUE:

1. Choose your weight and attach the handle to the lower cable pulley mount.

2. Grab the handle with an underhand grip (back of the hand facing down). Lift the handle with the cable attached by bending your knees, keeping your back straight, and standing up using your legs. Avoid lifting the weight with an arched back.

3. Keep your arms extended in front of your body.

4. Position yourself far enough away from the cable pull tower so that the weight is slightly lifted off the rest of the weight block in this extended position. This ensures that the selected weight doesnâ€™t rest on the block during the exercise.

5. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.

6. Now bend your elbows, bringing your forearms upwards. The handle and your hands move towards your face. The movement should come exclusively from your elbows.

7. At the end of the movement, lower your forearms back down in a controlled manner, maintaining muscle tension. Use the full range of motion for the best muscle stimulus.
