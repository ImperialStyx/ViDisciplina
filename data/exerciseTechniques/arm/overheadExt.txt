TECHNIQUE:

1. Hold the barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing forward), slightly narrower than shoulder-width, and keep it in front of your hips with your arms extended.

2. Sit up straight on the weight bench with a slight arch in your lower back. Rest the barbell, without changing your grip, on your thighs.

3. Lift the barbell over your head and extend your arms. Keep your elbows slightly bent. This is your starting position.

4. Lower the weight behind your head in a controlled manner by bending your elbows. Stop when your forearms are about parallel to the ground. Then, lift the barbell back to the starting position.
