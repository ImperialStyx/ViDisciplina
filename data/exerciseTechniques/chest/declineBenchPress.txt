TECHNIQUE:

1. Lie on the decline bench with the barbell level with your upper chest in the holder.

2. Secure your legs in the designated padding.

3. Pull your shoulder blades back.

4. Extend your arms, grip the barbell shoulder-width apart (or slightly wider).

5. Always use a closed grip with your thumb around the bar, not a “monkey grip” (open grip).

6. Lift the barbell out of the holder.

7. Lower the bar evenly and under control above your chest, keeping your elbows from flaring too far outwards.

8. Keep your shoulder blades drawn in and inhale as you lower the bar.

9. Due to the bench angle, the barbell will land lower than usual, around your nipples or lower chest, depending on your anatomy.

10. Perform the upward movement cleanly and quickly, exhaling as you do so.

11. At the top, maintain body tension, don’t fully extend your arms, and repeat the process.
