TECHNIQUE:

1. Lie on the flat bench with your back. The barbell bar in the holder should be at about eye level.

2. Keep your feet firmly on the ground. At the gym, some people lift their legs or place their feet on the bench, but you should avoid this. Keeping your feet on the ground provides the best stability.

3. Retract your shoulder blades.

4. Press your feet onto the floor and tense your lower back. That way you form a slight hollow back – the so-called “bridge”.

5. Extend your arms straight up and reach for the barbell. Then, move your hands outward by one hand width. Your grip should now be slightly wider than shoulder-width. A grip that’s too narrow will focus more on the triceps and less on the pectoral muscles, while a grip that’s too wide will activate the shoulder more. However, the optimal grip depends on your individual physique.

6. When gripping the barbell, your thumb should wrap around the bar for safety. Don’t use the so-called monkey grip (see below).

7. Lift the barbell bar out of the rack. Avoid bending your wrists too much.

8. Lower the bar evenly above your chest, not too fast. Keep your elbows directed downwards, towards your feet, rather than spreading them outwards to the sides. Keep your shoulder blades tucked in during the entire movement. Inhale as you lower the bar.

9. The exact spot where the barbell lands when you lower it depends on your individual anatomy. For some, it’s around nipple level, while for others it’s slightly above or below. Make sure not to lower the bar too close to your neck.

10. Opinions differ on whether the bar should touch your chest or not. As long as you don’t rest the weight on your body or use momentum to bounce it off your chest, it should not matter too much.

11. Perform the upward movement as quickly and evenly as possible, exhaling as you do so.

12. Once at the top, maintain body tension, avoid fully extending your arms, and repeat.
