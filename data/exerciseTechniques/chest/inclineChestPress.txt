TECHNIQUE:

1. Sit on the seat cushion and lean back. Your head and back should touch the backrest. Plant your feet firmly on the ground to stabilize your body in this position.

2. Hold the handles with an upper grip (palms facing up).

3. Push the weight slightly forward to feel tension in your chest. You’re now in the starting position.

4. Next, push the handles forward or upward. Keep your back and head pressed against the backrest. Don’t fully extend your arms; keep your elbows a bit bent. Hold this position briefly, then slowly and controlled, return the weight to the starting position.
