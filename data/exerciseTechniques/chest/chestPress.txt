TECHNIQUE:

1. Sit on the machine’s seat. Adjust the seat height so the handles are at chest level. Set the weight, starting a bit lower if it’s your first time using the machine.

2. On some chest press machines, you can also adjust the grip depth, changing the resting position of the handles. Ensure the handles aren’t too far back to avoid straining your shoulders. Some machines have a foot lever to help move the handles into position. In any case, make sure your hands aren’t behind your chest in the starting position.

3. Press your back into the back pad and keep your head upright.

4. With control push the handles forward. Don’t fully extend your elbows at the end of the movement; keep them slightly bent to maintain muscle tension.

5. Consciously follow the machine’s movement. On some machines, you push the handles directly forward, while on others, the handles move up at a slight angle.

6. Lower the weight back down in a controlled manner, returning your hands to the starting position. The moved weight should not touch the stationary weight at the end or beginning of a repetition. Only put the weight down when you finish the set.
