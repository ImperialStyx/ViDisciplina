TECHNIQUE:

1. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and sit on a flat bench. Start by placing the dumbbells on your thighs, near your knees. If the dumbbells are too heavy to lift, alternate lifting your knees with momentum to help lift the dumbbells with your arms.

2. Lie back on the flat bench, bringing the dumbbells close to your chest. Once you’re comfortably lying on the bench (head, shoulder blades/shoulders, and butt on the bench), lift the dumbbells straight up in front of your torso.

3. Retract your shoulder blades.

4. Slightly angle your elbows (about 10 degrees) and slowly lower the dumbbells outward, spreading your arms. In this final position, your chest should be stretched. Be careful not to lower the dumbbells too far (see below).

5. Raise the dumbbells again by rotating your arms upward. Keep your elbows bent and your shoulder blades tense and retracted throughout the movement.

6. After completing your set, lower the dumbbells towards your chest, and then sit up with a bit of momentum if necessary. Don’t just drop the dumbbells on the floor while your arms are spread out.
