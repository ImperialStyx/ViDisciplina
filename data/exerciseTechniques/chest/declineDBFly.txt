TECHNIQUE:

1. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and sit on the decline bench. Secure your legs under the pads. Hold the dumbbells near your belly.

2. Lean back, taking the dumbbells to your chest without swinging. Lie flat on the bench’s back pad.

3. While lying safely on the decline bench (head, shoulders/shoulder blades, and butt touching the bench), lift the dumbbells straight up in front of your torso.

4. Pull your shoulder blades back.

5. Bend your elbows about 10 degrees. Slowly lower the dumbbells by spreading your arms, stretching your chest in the final position. Don’t lower the dumbbells too far (see below).

6. Raise the dumbbells by rotating your arms up. Keep your elbows bent at the same angle throughout the entire movement, and your shoulder blades tight and pulled back.

7. After finishing your set, lower the dumbbells toward your chest and stand up if needed with a bit of momentum. Don’t just drop the dumbbells from the spread-arm position at the end of the exercise.
