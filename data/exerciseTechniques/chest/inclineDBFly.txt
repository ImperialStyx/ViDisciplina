TECHNIQUE:

1. Set the incline bench to about a 30-degree angle. If it’s too steep, flatten it a notch.

2. Grab the dumbbells and sit on the bench seat. Place the dumbbells on your thighs near your knees. If the dumbbells are too heavy to lift, alternate lifting your knees upward with momentum to help raise the dumbbells when lying down.

3. Lean back and lie on the bench’s backrest. Hold the dumbbells close to your chest. Once you’re safely lying on the bench, push the dumbbells straight up.

4. Pull back your shoulder blades.

5. Angle your elbows and lower the dumbbells outward in a controlled manner, spreading your arms. In this final position, the chest is stretched. Don’t lower your arms too far, and avoid straightening your elbows or causing pain.

6. Raise the dumbbells again by rotating your arms upward. Keep your elbows and shoulder blades in the same position (elbows bent; shoulder blades pulled in).

7. At the end of your set, lower the dumbbells back down towards your chest and then raise your torso with a bit of momentum.
