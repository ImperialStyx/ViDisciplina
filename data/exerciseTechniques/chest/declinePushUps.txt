TECHNIQUE:

1. Kneel on the ground and lean forward, supporting yourself with your arms (shoulder-width apart).

2. Extend both legs and place your toes securely on the elevated object (flat bench, chair, sofa, etc.).

3. Extend both arms and position your hands roughly below your shoulders. Keep your hands no more than shoulder-width apart.

4. Tighten your core, so your head, upper body, and legs form almost a straight line. Don’t stick your butt out too far or let your hips sag. You’re now in the starting position.

5. Slowly and controlled, lower your upper body by bending your arms. End the movement when your elbows are completely bent or your chest is about to touch the ground.

6. Hold the position for a moment and straighten your arms (almost) completely. Keep your body tense in the manner described above throughout the entire movement.
