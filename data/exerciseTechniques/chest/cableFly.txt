TECHNIQUE:

1. Stand in the middle of the cable pull tower, holding the handles with your arms spread and palms facing forward.

2. Take a step forward, keeping one leg in front of the other for stabilization. The weight should not move yet.

3. Lean your upper body forward slightly, creating a small arch in your back. Your arms should remain extended with elbows slightly bent.

4. Push the handles forward through your shoulders, keeping your arms extended and elbows minimally bent throughout the movement.

5. Bring the handles together in front of your body at chest height and hold for a moment. The tension in your chest is at its highest now.

6. Control your arms as you spread them again, but don’t go too far back so that the tension in your chest isn’t completely lost. The weight you’re moving should not touch the rest of the weight block until the end of the set.
