TECHNIQUE:

1. Kneel on the floor and lean your upper body forward far enough, so you can support yourself with your hands (shoulder width).

2. Extend both legs and balance on your toes.

3. Extend both arms and move your hands, so they’re roughly below your shoulders. If you like, you can vary the width of your support in this step (see above).

4. Tense your core so that your head, upper body, and legs form a nearly straight line. Don’t stick your butt out too far and don’t let your pelvis sag. You’re now in the starting position.

5. Slowly and controlled, lower your upper body down by bending your arms. End the movement when your chest is just above the floor. If you’re using a higher support position for your arms or legs, end the movement when your elbows are fully bent.

6. Hold the position for a brief moment and then straighten your arms (almost) all the way. Keep your body tensed throughout the entire movement in the manner described earlier.
